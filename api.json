      "summary": "A female spirit from Irish folklore who appears or wails to announce an impending death in certain families. The banshee's supernatural cry, known as keening, serves as a death omen. She is attached to specific Irish families and appears in various forms: as an old hag, a beautiful woman, or washing bloody clothes at a river.",
      "full": "The banshee (Irish: bean sí, meaning 'woman of the fairy mound') is one of the most famous figures in Irish folklore. She is a female spirit whose appearance or wailing cry announces that a member of a certain family is about to die. The banshee is traditionally attached to specific Irish families, particularly those with surnames beginning with 'O' or 'Mac.' She appears in various forms: as a keening old woman in tattered clothes, as a beautiful young woman with flowing hair, or as a washerwoman at a river ford cleaning bloody clothes. Her most distinctive feature is her wail—a supernatural cry of mourning that strikes terror and sorrow in those who hear it. The banshee is not considered malevolent; rather, she serves as a family guardian whose role is to mourn the passing of family members. The tradition of the banshee remains part of living Irish folk culture, with modern claimed experiences continuing to be reported."
